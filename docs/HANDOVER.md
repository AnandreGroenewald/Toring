# Stapel — handover for the next agent

**Read this first, then `docs/SPEC.md` (game architecture) and `docs/SPONSORS-SPEC.md` (sponsorship system).**
Branch: `claude/trusting-hopper-26qcax` (develop and push here; don't open a pull request unless the owner asks).
Repo: `AnandreGroenewald/Toring`. Owner: Anandré Groenewald.

## 1. What the owner asked for

> Build "Stapel", a free Afrikaans block-stacking phone game that runs in the browser. Tagline: "Stapel hoog. Staan sterk."
>
> THE FEEL (borrow from proven hits)
> - Wordle: one Daaglikse Toring a day, the same blocks and weather for everyone, one scored try, a streak, a countdown to the next tower, and an emoji share line for WhatsApp.
> - Stack (Ketchapp): instant one-finger play, a bright "Perfek!" flash and combo bonus when a block lands dead centre.
> - Tower Bloxx: a crane up top, the tower growing tall, height shown in metres.
> - Tricky Towers: events hit your tower while you build, and a line you must stay above.
> - Jenga: the wobble and tension of a tall tower.
>
> TECH
> - Phaser 3 with its built-in Matter.js physics, saved into this repository.
> - index.html at the repository root, so GitHub Pages can serve it straight from the main branch.
> - Shapes and colours drawn in code, emoji for weather, short WebAudio sounds. Whole game under 3 MB, smooth at 60 fps on a mid-range Android phone, portrait layout.

Later the owner added (decisions are final unless they say otherwise):

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Quality | "Do not cut corners for usage limit." Thorough testing and reviews are expected. |
| Business model | Monthly **sponsorships**: businesses pay to get **their name on the blocks**. |
| Premium ad | A large ad for a sponsor paying **R1 499 per month**: an exclusive **billboard on the island** next to the tower base. |
| House ad | **sportscard.co.za** is the owner's own business: a permanent pinned card on the **menu** (label it "Advertensie"). We couldn't fetch the site (egress blocked), so the copy is neutral and lives in `sponsors.json`. |
| Name-on-blocks price | **Not shown** anywhere on the site; it only appears on Paystack's checkout (the owner sets the plan amount). |
| Sign-up and payment | **Fully automatic**, using **Paystack** (ZAR, monthly plans). The backend is a Cloudflare Worker + D1, because the site is static on GitHub Pages. |
| WhatsApp share text | Stays **clean**: no sponsor mentions. |
| Public contact email | The owner will create one and send it later. Until then `SPONSOR.contactEmail` stays `''` and the UI hides it. Do **not** publish the owner's personal Gmail. |
| Brand names | Other games' names must not appear in the game or public docs. The README was already rewritten; the last code comments mentioning other games are task T5 below. |
| Legal | Third-party MIT notices are in `lib/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`. The owner was told to do a CIPC trademark search on "Stapel", fill in and lawyer-check the legal templates, register an Information Officer (POPIA), and ask an accountant about tax. |

## 4. Things only the owner can do

1. **Paystack:** create and verify a business account. Create two **monthly ZAR plans**: one for name-on-blocks (any amount the owner chooses) and one for the billboard at R1 499 = 149900 cents. Copy the secret key and both plan codes.
2. **Cloudflare:** create a free account, then follow `server/README.md` (`wrangler login`, `d1 create`, schema, secrets, deploy), and point Paystack's webhook at `https://<worker>/paystack/webhook`.
3. **Go live:** set `SPONSOR_API_URL` in `js/sponsorConfig.js`. That one value switches on the "Adverteer hier" link, the sign-up form and the "Jou advertensie hier" billboard. Test first with Paystack test keys and test cards.
4. **Contact email:** send the public contact email, which goes in `SPONSOR.contactEmail`.
5. **Legal templates:** fill in the `[[placeholders]]` in `terme.html` and `privaatheid.html` (legal name, address, registration number, Information Officer), get them reviewed, then remove the template banner.
6. **GitHub Pages:** merge into `main`, then Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.

## 5. How to work on this repo

- No build step. Serve the root statically: `npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1 .`, then open `index.html?nosw=1&debug=1`.
- Tests: `npm test` (game core, node --test). Sponsor backend: `cd server && npm test`.
- Debug params (only with `?debug=1`, which uses separate storage `stapel.v1.debug` so it never touches real stats): `date=YYYY-MM-DD`, `auto=<aimErrorRate>` (autoplay), `seed=<practice seed>`. `?nosw=1` skips the service worker.
- Test hooks: `window.__stapel = { game, bus, store, ui, audio, scene }`, plus `scene.getState()`.
- Headless browser (cloud containers): Playwright with Chromium args `['--use-gl=angle','--use-angle=swiftshader','--enable-unsafe-swiftshader']`, mobile context `{ viewport: { width: 412, height: 915 }, deviceScaleFactor: 2.625, isMobile: true, hasTouch: true }`. Headless fps is only 11–15 because rendering is in software; judge performance by CPU ms per frame, not fps.
- Every release: bump `VERSION` in `js/config.js` **and** the cache name in `sw.js` (a test checks they agree and that every module is precached). Changes to `js/core/sequence.js`, `js/core/weatherplan.js` or the physics change every daily tower, so ship them before local midnight; `tests/sequence.test.js` has a golden snapshot of daily #1 that must be updated deliberately.
- All player-facing text is Afrikaans and lives in `js/core/strings.js`. Numbers use `js/core/format.js` (decimal comma, non-breaking spaces).
- The `docs/workflows/*.js` files are the multi-agent workflow scripts used so far (Claude Code Workflow tool). They're useful as prompts even if you work solo. `<SCRATCH>` in them was a temporary directory.
- Egress in the cloud container used so far blocked paystack.com, developers.cloudflare.com, cdn.jsdelivr.net and sportscard.co.za; the npm registry and web search worked.
